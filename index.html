              These three are all "falsy" values but certainly are distinct
              concepts representing different values and purposes in js.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Undefined" is automatically assigned to variables that are
              declared but not yet initialized. It is also the default value for
              function parameters that are not assigned and object properties
              that don't exist.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Null" on the other hand is a special needs to be explicitly
              assigned to a variable or an object property to indicate the
              absence of a meaningful value.

              In JavaScript, "const", "let", and "var" are used to declare
              variables. Addition of "let" and "const" was one of the features
              that came with ES6. There are Key differences between these three:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                "var" declarations are globally scoped or function/locally
                scoped. The scope is global when a "var" variable is declared
                outside a function. "var" is function scoped when it is declared
                within a function. This means that it is available and can be
                accessed only within that function. "var" variables can be
                re-declared and updated. This means that we can do this within
                the same scope and won't get an error. It's also hoisted to the
                top of its scope.
              </li>
              <li>
                "let" is block-scoped, meaning it's limited to the block,
                statement, or expression where it is declared. It's not hoisted,
                and you can reassign its value.
              </li>
              <li>
                "const" is also block-scoped, but once a value is assigned, it
                cannot be reassigned. It's a constant variable.
              </li>
            </ol>

              Q8 - What are the differences between a library and a framework?
              Provide Examples.

            <p>
              The main difference between a library and a framework is in the
              level of control and structure that is provided. A library gives
              you more freedom and is used for specific tasks, while a framework
              provides a more extensive structure and enforces certain patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
              A library is a collection of pre-written code, often with a
              specific purpose, that can be reused in various projects. A
              library provides functions, classes, and routines that you can use
              in your code, but it doesn't dictate the overall structure or flow
              of your application. You call the library's functions when needed,
              and you have more control over how you structure your code. jQuery
              is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies tasks like DOM
              manipulation. React is also often described as a library, not a
              framework.
            </p>
            <p>
              A framework is a more comprehensive, structured set of tools,
              libraries, and conventions designed to help you build and organize
              an entire application. It often includes predefined structures,
              design patterns, and guidelines, and your code fits into the
              framework's architecture. Angular and Vue are typically
              categorized as a framework, not just a library.
